# AMAZON-CLONE
As an individual passionate about web development, I have successfully created an Amazon webpage clone using my self-developed skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. With a deep understanding of these fundamental building blocks, I meticulously studied the original website's design, layout, and functionality. This allowed me to replicate its structure and content while adding my own touch of creativity. By continuously learning and improving my skills, I strive to not only create clone pages but also develop original, innovative web designs that stand out in the ever-evolving digital landscape. Additionally, I recognize the importance of responsive and mobile-friendly designs in today's tech-savvy world. To meet this demand, I am dedicated to enhancing my knowledge of Bootstrap, a front-end framework that enables me to create webpages that seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes. By combining my technical expertise with a keen eye for detail, I am confident in my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly webpages that captivate and engage users.
